The Object-Fit Concept :

Divide target width by original width.
Divide target height by original height.
Pick the smallest number and multiply it by the original width and height

// time tp radis
If we use Redis, we have a 3-Layer Search:

If i  100,000 images, im  using 1.2GB of RAM.
Layer 1: Is it in Redis RAM? (Super Fast)
Layer 2: If not, is it on the D: Drive Disk? (Fast)
Layer 3: If not, resize it now! (Slow)

Hot-Warm-Cold" Strategy

In a professional setup, you wouldn't put every image in Redis. You would implement a TTL (Time To Live)
